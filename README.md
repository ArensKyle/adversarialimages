Creating adversarial images for attacking a neural net

Python 3 required.

Use:
1. Run 'pip install -r requirements.txt' to install dependencies. 
2. Navigate to src folder, type the below to run.
    python3 attack.py
3. This will generate an image titled attack.jpg that is subtly different from the image titled orig.jpg, and return an input of frilled lizard, Chlamydosaurus kingi.
4. If you wish to test with other images, simply replace orig.jpg with a new image. Square images are best.
